Currently I'm using InnoDB as the engine and using a compostite primary key of the timestamp column and a uuid.

Can only partition on a field which is contained in the primary key in MySQL which is irksome.

I may be changing this as in the testing I ran (admittedly on an underpowered box) the insert speed I was getting
was quite poor
